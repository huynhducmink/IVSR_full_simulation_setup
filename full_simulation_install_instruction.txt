1. Instruction to install a full UAV navigation simulation system
Include:
- PX4
- Flightmare
- VIO utilities
- VINS-Fusion
- Ewok optimization
- PD velocity controller

# Ubuntu: 
Ubuntu 20.04

#ROS: Noetic
http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu

#Every package can be installed in the same workspace except PX4, sample file management below
sample_folder/flightmare_ws/src/
sample_folder/PX4-Autopilot/

#PX4 
Install PX4
	https://docs.px4.io/main/en/dev_setup/building_px4.html
remember to use make px4_sitl gazebo

Script for setup all dependencies (use with precaution as it is meant to be used for ROS Melodic)(fix dependencies by hand would be better, contact Minh to help and please document if possible, tks)
	https://docs.px4.io/main/en/dev_setup/dev_env_linux_ubuntu.html
	bash ./PX4-Autopilot/Tools/setup/ubuntu.sh --no-nuttx --no-sim-tools

QGroundControl
	start PX4 (roslaunch px4 mavros_posix_sitl.launch)
	open QGroundControl.AppImage (if cannot run open properties/Permissions/Allow executing file as program)
	Click on Q symbol on top left corner
	Choose Vehicle setup
	Choose Parameters
	Find COM_RCL_EXCEPT and set to 4 (offboard mode)

#Flightmare
Follow the instruction to install Flightmare
	https://flightmare.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/quick_start.html#quick-start

protoc 3.6.1 is fine on Ubuntu 20.04, no need for version 3.0.0 like the instruction said

After finish installing Flightmare, replace the contents in the flightros folder with the contents in the repo (this folder have added camera, connect with PX4+Gazebo, some other small thing ...)
https://github.com/huynhducmink/flightros_for_PX4-Gazebo.git

#Odometry
Eigen and Ceres-solver dont need to be install to ros workspace, download to ~/Downloads and follow the instruction, both will be installed to root

INSTALL EIGEN BEFORE INSTALL CERES !!!

Eigen 3.4.0 (https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
	Instruction to install Eigen is in the INSTALL file included in the download package

ceres-solver 2.1.0 (http://ceres-solver.org/installation.html)
	As ceres-solver 2.1.0 require fully C++17 compliant compiler, any ROS package that report ceres related error can be fix by changing all C++ standard in the CMakeList.txt of that package to C++17

VINS-Fusion
git clone https://github.com/huynhducmink/VINS-Fusion

#Planning
sudo apt install ros-noetic-sophus
git clone https://github.com/huynhducmink/ewok_optimization_DN.git

#Control
catkin config --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
git clone https://github.com/ethz-asl/mav_trajectory_generation.git
git clone https://github.com/huynhducmink/offboard

#VIO utilities
https://github.com/huynhducmink/Visual_odometry_utilities

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
catkin build
(Errors may occur):
	1. Fatal error: nlopt.hpp: no such file or directory 
	=> Fix: sudo apt install libnlopt-cxx-dev
	2. Could not find a package configuration file provided by "eigen_checks"/"nlopt"/"glog_catkin"
	=> Fix: 
		+ cd catkin_ws/src
		+ wstool init
		+ wstool set eigen_checks https://github.com/ethz-asl/eigen_checks --git
		+ wstool update eigen_checks
		(do the same with the others, you don't need to wstool init many times)
		
2. Edit ~/.bashrc
after catkin build successfully, add the following lines to ~/.bashrc (ORDER IS IMPORTANT), then fix all to correct path

source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
source /home/huynhmink/ROS_workspaces/flightmare_ws/devel/setup.bash
export FLIGHTMARE_PATH=~/flightmare_ws/src/flightmare

source /home/huynhmink/ROS_workspaces/PX4-Autopilot/Tools/setup_gazebo.bash /home/huynhmink/ROS_workspaces/PX4-Autopilot /home/huynhmink/ROS_workspaces/PX4-Autopilot/build/px4_sitl_default
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:/home/huynhmink/ROS_workspaces/PX4-Autopilot
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:/home/huynhmink/ROS_workspaces/PX4-Autopilot/Tools/sitl_gazebo
export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=$GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gazebo-11/plugins

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Instruction to run full simulation

roslaunch px4 mavros_posix_sitl.launch

rosrun read_topic vio_transform
choose option 1

roslaunch flightros rotors_gazebo.launch

rosrun vins vins_node ~/ROS_workspaces/flightmare_ws/src/VINS-Fusion/config/euroc/euroc_stereo_imu_config.yaml
edit the path to correct path

roslaunch msf_updates viconpos_sensor.launch

roslaunch ewok_optimization optimization_point.launch

roslaunch offboard planner.launch simulation:=true
choose 2 then 3 to enter planner flight mode

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Instruction to config each package

# msf
file launch in ethzasl_msf/msf_updates/launch/viconpos_sensor.launch show the remap for the pose input and imu input of the multi sensor fusion package
/vio_odo_posestamped is output of odometry package change to posestamped format by VIO_utilities package


# ewok optimization
file ewok_optimization/launch/optimization_point.launch have preset trajectory
if change trajectory also need to change number_of_target

file ewok_optimization/example/spline_optimization_example3.cpp
- fx,fy,cx,cy depend on output image from Flightmare
- custom transform from /map to /base_link is created here
	transform from /world to /map is in launch file
	transform from /base_link to /camera_link is set in flightmare (as it output image)
	to create a full tf tree from world to map to base_link to /camera_link to transform esdf map from /camera_link back to /world
- depth_image_sub_ sub to /depth topic from flightmare
- current_pose_sub sub to current pose to check for position of the drone to start output planning point. currently set to /msf_core/pose_after_update, set to /vio_odo_posestamped if you dont run msf
- to run without odometry
	set current_pose_sub to /mavros/local_position/pose
	comment custom transform from /map to base_link
	change /opt/ros/noetic/share/mavros/launch/px4_config.yaml line 71 from false to true to publish transform from /map to /base_link using px4

# Flightmare
file flightros/src/pilot/flight_pilot.cpp
- B_r_BC and B_r_BC2 set position of stereo camera (cam 1 double as depth camera)
- set POV, Width and Height of output image
- sub_state_est_ sub to /mavros/local_position/pose and each received pose render 2 RGB and 1 Depth image
- depth image have frame_id as /camera_link to use with ewok

# Offboard

planner.launch
have start and endpoint of trajectory set in planner, start and endpoint must be different otherwise the controller will detect start point is same is endpoint and land imediately
change PID_kp to change accelleration to max speed (set in offboard_lib.cpp)

offboard_lib.cpp
odom_sub_ to current pose, currently sub to /msf_core/odometry (output of msf), change to /mavros/local_position/odom to fly using groundtruth or /vio_odo to fly using output of odometry
important function is the cal_vel function that calculate velocity from input setpoint and current position

# VINS-FUSION
file config/euroc/euroc_stereo_imu_config.yaml is used when running the package
config parameter have explaination comment from author
file euroc_stereo_imu_config.yaml, cam0_pinhole.yaml and cam1_pinhole.yaml need to match the image resolution

# VIO_utilities
take groundtruth and publish different ros message formats
transform output of visual odometry from /vio_frame to /world frame and publish in diffrent formats
